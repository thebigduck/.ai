# Sample `.ai` Directory

This sample follows the [AI Directory Standard](../README.md) and provides a starting point for new projects.

Each subfolder contains placeholder files that you can customize:

- `0-ai-config/` – Configuration files for AI tools.
- `1-context/` – High-level project information and context.
- `2-technical-design/` – Architectural notes and requirements.
- `3-development/` – Development logs and temporary locks.
- `4-acceptance/` – Criteria and reports for project acceptance.

Replace the placeholder content with information relevant to your project to make the `.ai` folder a useful guide for both humans and AI assistants.
